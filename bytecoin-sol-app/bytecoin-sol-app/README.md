## Features

### 1. Wallet Integration

The application integrates with various Solana wallets including:
- Phantom
- Solflare
- Torus
- Ledger

Users can connect their wallets to access their S-BYTE tokens and interact with the application.

### 2. Portfolio Management

The Portfolio page displays:
- S-BYTE token balance
- SOL balance
- Total portfolio value in USD
- Historical balance chart
- Recent transactions

### 3. Send/Receive Functionality

Users can:
- Send S-BYTE tokens to other Solana wallets
- View transaction history
- See transaction fees (3% for S-BYTE transfers)
- Generate receive QR codes for their wallet address

### 4. PVP Games (Draughts)

The Games page features:
- Fully functional draughts (checkers) game
- S-BYTE token wagering system
- Game history and statistics
- Matchmaking functionality

### 5. Fee Transparency

The Fees page shows:
- Total fees collected
- Fee allocation breakdown
- Weekly fee collection chart
- Development progress funded by fees

### 6. Admin Panel

Authorized administrators can:
- Update the S-BYTE token mint address
- Withdraw collected fees
- Configure game settings
- View system statistics

### 7. Future Swap Functionality

The Swap page provides information about:
- The upcoming ByteCoin blockchain
- The future swap process from S-BYTE to ByteCoin
- Timeline and roadmap for the transition

## Technical Implementation

### Context Providers

The application uses several context providers to manage state:

1. **WalletContextProvider**: Manages wallet connection and Solana network connection
2. **TokenContext**: Handles token balances, metadata, and transaction history
3. **TransferContext**: Manages token transfers with fee calculation
4. **AdminContext**: Provides admin functionality and authentication
5. **GameContext**: Handles game state and wagering

### Solana Integration

The application interacts with the Solana blockchain through:

1. **Web3.js**: For basic Solana operations like connecting to the network and sending transactions
2. **SPL Token**: For token-specific operations like transfers and balance checks
3. **Wallet Adapter**: For connecting to and interacting with Solana wallets

### Fee Mechanism

The 3% transaction fee for S-BYTE transfers is implemented using:

1. **Transfer Calculation**: The fee is calculated client-side before the transaction
2. **Token Extensions**: The Solana Token Extensions Program is used to handle fee collection
3. **Fee Transparency**: All collected fees are tracked and displayed in the application

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel, which provides:

1. **Global CDN**: Fast access from anywhere in the world
2. **HTTPS**: Secure connection for all users
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Easy updates when new features are added

### Deployment Configuration

The application uses the following configuration for deployment:

1. **vercel.json**: Contains routing and environment variable configuration
2. **config-overrides.js**: Provides webpack configuration overrides for Node.js polyfills

## Maintenance

### Updating the Application

To update the application:

1. Make changes to the codebase
2. Test locally using `npm start`
3. Build the application using `npm run build`
4. Deploy to Vercel using the Vercel CLI or GitHub integration

### Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK`: The Solana network to connect to (mainnet, devnet, testnet)
- `REACT_APP_ADMIN_WALLETS`: Comma-separated list of wallet addresses authorized for admin access

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet Connection Issues**: If users have trouble connecting their wallets, ensure they have the wallet extension installed and are on the correct network.
2. **Transaction Failures**: If transactions fail, check the Solana network status and ensure users have enough SOL for transaction fees.
3. **Admin Access**: If admin functions aren't working, verify the admin wallet addresses in the environment variables.

## Future Development

### ByteCoin Blockchain Transition

The application is designed to support the future transition to the ByteCoin blockchain:

1. **Swap Functionality**: Will allow users to swap S-BYTE tokens for ByteCoin
2. **Dual Support**: Will support both Solana and ByteCoin during the transition period
3. **Seamless Migration**: Will provide a smooth experience for users during the transition

### Planned Features

1. **Enhanced PVP Games**: Additional games beyond draughts
2. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android
3. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed portfolio and transaction analytics
4. **Social Features**: Friend lists, direct transfers, and social gaming
