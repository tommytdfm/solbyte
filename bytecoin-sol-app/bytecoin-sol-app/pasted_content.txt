I want to build a web-based app called "ByteCoin on Sol App" that serves as a user-friendly platform for interacting with a Solana-based token called "ByteCoin on Sol" (S-BYTE), with plans to transition to a new blockchain called ByteCoin. The app will also include an admin panel for managing token details and fees, accessible only to a few authorized users. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the app’s features and requirements:
Core Concept and Token Details:
The app introduces "ByteCoin on Sol" (S-BYTE), a Solana-based token that users can interact with now, with a future transition to a new standalone blockchain called ByteCoin.

The ByteCoin blockchain will be a new network where 1 ByteCoin (N-BYTE) is designed to be 8x the value of a bit, reflecting the fact that 1 byte equals 8 bits. This positions ByteCoin as a higher-value cryptocurrency compared to bit-based coins like Bitcoin.

Users who hold S-BYTE will be able to swap it for N-BYTE (e.g., 1:1 ratio with a potential bonus) once the ByteCoin blockchain launches.
Wallet Integration and Asset Viewing:
Users can connect to the app using their Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) via a "Connect Wallet" button.

After connecting, users can view their assets, including their S-BYTE balance, other Solana-based tokens, and SOL (Solana’s native token).

The app should have a dedicated "Portfolio" section where users can see their assets in a visually appealing way, with charts and graphs (e.g., a pie chart showing asset distribution, a line graph showing S-BYTE value over time).
Send and Receive S-BYTE and Other Tokens:
Users can send and receive S-BYTE, other Solana tokens, and SOL directly within the app.

Include a simple form: users input the recipient’s wallet address and the amount to send, then confirm the transaction with their wallet.

Display a 3% transaction fee for S-BYTE transfers (implemented via Solana’s Token Extensions Program) and explain the fee clearly: "A 3% fee is collected on S-BYTE transfers to raise capital for developing the new ByteCoin blockchain, where 1 ByteCoin will be 8x the value of a bit."
Fee Collection and Transparency:
The 3% transaction fees on S-BYTE transfers are initially held in the recipient’s token account as withheld tokens. These fees are periodically withdrawn to a central fee account (a token account I control) using the withdrawWithheldTokens instruction.

Display the total amount of fees collected in the central fee account in a prominent section of the app (e.g., on the homepage).

Show the fee total in both S-BYTE and USD (using an API like CoinGecko for conversion). For example: "Total Fees Raised: 10,000 S-BYTE ($500 USD)."

Include a brief explanation: "These fees help fund the creation of the ByteCoin blockchain, a new network where your S-BYTE will become even more valuable!"
S-BYTE to ByteCoin Swap Placeholder:
Add a section called "Swap to ByteCoin" that informs users about the future transition: "Hold S-BYTE now and swap it for ByteCoin (N-BYTE) when our new blockchain launches! 1 ByteCoin = 8x the value of a bit."

For now, this section can display a message: "Coming Soon: Swap your S-BYTE for N-BYTE with a potential bonus for early adopters."
PVP Games (Draughts with Wagering):
Include a "Games" section where users can play draughts (checkers) against each other in a player-versus-player (PVP) format.

Users can wager S-BYTE on the game. For example, each player agrees to bet 10 S-BYTE, and the winner receives the total (20 S-BYTE minus the 3% fee).

Implement a simple matchmaking system: users join a lobby, pair with an opponent, and start the game.

Notify users that more games and apps are coming soon: "Stay tuned for more exciting games and apps in the ByteCoin ecosystem!"
Admin Panel for Authorized Users:
Create a separate "Admin Panel" section accessible only to a few authorized users (myself and a few team members).

Restrict access to the admin panel using Solana wallet authentication: only specific wallet addresses (stored in an environment variable, e.g., AUTHORIZED_WALLETS=MyWalletAddress,TeamMemberAddress) can access the panel.

When a user tries to access the admin panel, prompt them to sign a message with their Solana wallet. Verify their wallet address against the authorized list before granting access.

Admin Panel Features:
Input S-BYTE Mint Address: A form to input the S-BYTE mint address (since the token isn’t created yet). Once entered, the app uses this address to interact with S-BYTE (e.g., for balances, transfers, and fee tracking).

View and Manage Fees: Display the total fees collected in the central fee account and provide a button to trigger the withdrawWithheldTokens instruction to aggregate fees from recipient accounts.

Game Settings: Allow admins to adjust wager limits for the draughts game (e.g., set a minimum/maximum S-BYTE wager).
Ensure the admin panel has a simple, secure UI with clear labels (e.g., “Enter S-BYTE Mint Address Here”).
User Experience and Design:
Ensure the app is pleasant, accessible, and easy to use for all users, including beginners.

Use a clean, intuitive design with a light color scheme (e.g., soft blues and whites) to create a welcoming feel.

Include clear labels and tooltips (e.g., “What’s S-BYTE? A Solana-based token you can swap for ByteCoin later!”).

Make navigation simple with a sidebar menu: "Home," "Portfolio," "Send/Receive," "Swap to ByteCoin," "Games," "Fees Raised," and "Admin Panel" (visible only to authorized users).

Use large, readable fonts and high-contrast buttons (e.g., a bright "Connect Wallet" button).

Ensure the app is mobile-responsive for accessibility on all devices.
Technical Requirements:
Build the app using React for the frontend.

Integrate Solana wallet connectivity using @solana/wallet-adapter.

Query the S-BYTE balance and transaction fees using @solana/web3.js and @solana/spl-token.

Use Chart.js to create visual charts and graphs in the Portfolio section.

Fetch S-BYTE to USD conversion rates using the CoinGecko API.

Store the S-BYTE mint address in a configuration file or database, updated via the admin panel.

Secure the admin panel with wallet-based authentication, using environment variables to store authorized wallet addresses.

Deploy the app to Vercel to make it publicly accessible.
Additional Features for Engagement:
Add a welcome message on the homepage: "Welcome to ByteCoin on Sol! A byte is 8 bits, so ByteCoin is 8x the value—join the future of crypto!"

Include a FAQ section addressing common questions: "Why is there a 3% fee? To fund the ByteCoin blockchain!" and "When can I swap S-BYTE for N-BYTE? Soon—stay tuned!"
This app should be a gateway for users to interact with S-BYTE, understand the value proposition of ByteCoin, and engage with the ecosystem through games and asset management, while providing admins with a secure panel to manage token details and fees, all while maintaining a pleasant and accessible user experience.
